    <h2>Enterprise-ready open source software - managed for you</h2>
    <p>
        The Tidelift Subscription is a managed open source subscription for application dependencies covering
        millions of open source projects across JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your subscription includes:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
ðŸ¡† <span  class="note" data-note="Tideliftâ€™s security response team coordinates patches for new breaking security vulnerabilities and alerts immediately through a private channel, so your software supply chain is always secure.">Security updates</span>
ðŸ¡† <span  class="note" data-note="Tidelift verifies license information to enable easy policy enforcement and adds intellectual property indemnification to cover creators and users in case something goes wrong. You always have a 100% up-to-date bill of materials for your dependencies to share with your legal team, customers, or partners.">Licensing verification and indemnification</span>
ðŸ¡† <span  class="note" data-note="Tidelift ensures the software you rely on keeps working as long as you need it to work. Your managed dependencies are actively maintained and we recruit additional maintainers where required.">Maintenance and code improvement</span>
ðŸ¡† <span  class="note" data-note="We help you choose the best open source packages from the startâ€”and then guide you through updates to stay on the best releases as new issues arise.">Package selection and version guidance</span>
ðŸ¡† <span  class="note" data-note="Take a seat at the table with the creators behind the software you use. Tideliftâ€™s participating maintainers earn more income as their software is used by more subscribers, so theyâ€™re interested in knowing what you need.">Roadmap input</span>
ðŸ¡† <span  class="note" data-note="Tidelift works with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and more. We support every cloud platform (and other deployment targets, too).">Tooling and cloud integration</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open source you use.
        That means less time grappling with esoteric open source trivia, and more time building your own applicationsâ€”and your business.
